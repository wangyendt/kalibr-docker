name: technical-book-writer
description: Write rigorous, readable, book-like technical documentation for mathematical, robotics, calibration, state-estimation, optimization, and code-derived derivations. Use when the user asks for thesis-style chapters, from-scratch explanations, story-telling technical books, derivation-heavy knowhow, symbol tables, chapter plans, formula/Jacobian explanations, or when existing notes feel like answer dumps, changelogs, code comments, or unexplained final results.

# Technical Book Writer

## Purpose

Use this skill to turn difficult technical material into a coherent book chapter, not a note dump. The output should read like a careful graduate textbook: concepts appear only after prerequisites, formulas are derived before they are used, and source-code facts are separated from theory.

## Core Workflow

1. Audit the reader path before writing.
   - List the concepts the chapter needs.
   - Order them by dependency: primitives, notation, model, residual, Jacobian, source mapping.
   - Move anything that uses an undefined concept later, or add a short working definition first.
   - Model the reader's background explicitly. If the reader knows the theory but not the implementation, treat implementation concepts as first-class teaching targets.

2. Define a symbol ledger.
   - Define each symbol once, close to first use.
   - Keep one notation system as the book language.
   - Put code variable names in a bridge table instead of mixing them into derivations.
   - For competing conventions, state which convention is default and how to convert.

3. Explain unfamiliar implementation concepts before using them.
   - When introducing project-specific architecture, naming, update rules, graph abstractions, source conventions, or nonstandard design choices, give a short conceptual explanation before relying on them in formulas.
   - If the reader is familiar with the theory source, such as Micro Lie Theory, but unfamiliar with the implementation, bridge from the familiar theory to the implementation concept.
   - Use minimal examples when a source concept is not obvious from mathematics alone.
   - Separate "what the implementation stores or updates" from "what the mathematical derivation differentiates against."

4. Write as a story, not as a changelog.
   - Do not mention "previous version", "we changed", "this patch", or process history inside the book body.
   - Put revision notes in conversation summaries, plans, or commit messages, not in the chapter.
   - Begin each chapter with the reader's problem: what they do not yet understand and what the chapter will make clear.

5. Derive before presenting final formulas.
   - Start from a simple physical or geometric statement.
   - Introduce the smallest useful formula.
   - Expand first order terms explicitly when signs matter.
   - Name the source of each minus sign: residual direction, frame direction, perturbation convention, or algebraic identity.

6. Separate theory from implementation.
   - Use theory notation for the main derivation.
   - Add a bridge table for source variables and functions.
   - Explain implementation-specific variants after the standard theory, unless the chapter is explicitly about code.
   - When source behavior differs from the theory convention, write the conversion formula.

7. Re-read as a dependency graph.
   - Scan from top to bottom and flag first uses of every symbol and concept.
   - Ensure no section depends on a later definition.
   - Check that examples and formulas use the current symbol ledger.
   - Remove orphaned details that do not answer the chapter's core question.

8. Reconnect context after every edit.
   - After modifying a section, scan the local subsection, the whole chapter, adjacent chapters, and cross-chapter references for related concepts that now need updates.
   - Update nearby definitions, summary bullets, source mapping tables, appendices, and chapter plans when the edit changes terminology or reader assumptions.
   - Add a short forward or backward pointer when two separated derivations depend on the same idea.
   - Avoid leaving isolated explanations that solve one local question but do not connect to the book's narrative.

## Chapter Shape

Use this order for derivation-heavy chapters:

1. Reader question: what confusion this chapter resolves.
2. Physical intuition: what is being compared or transformed.
3. Minimal symbols: frames, variables, dimensions, and conventions.
4. Standard theory: clean derivation independent of source code.
5. Convention bridge: local/global, left/right, active/passive, or other variants.
6. Code bridge: variable names, functions, expression nodes, or files.
7. Final formula: now justified by the derivation.
8. Common traps: only those that follow from the derivation.
9. Chapter summary: compact takeaways, no revision history.

## Formula Discipline

- Use bold uppercase for matrices and group elements, bold lowercase for vectors, and scalar lowercase for time and indices unless the project defines otherwise.
- State dimensions when a symbol first appears if ambiguity is likely.
- Do not show a final Jacobian without the perturbation definition it differentiates against.
- Do not mix residual minus signs with perturbation convention signs.
- For Lie groups, say whether tangent vectors are local/right or global/left.
- If using a code-specific perturbation, give it a distinct notation and define its relation to the theory notation.
- For Jacobians, write what is held fixed and what is perturbed.
- For implementation-specific concepts, first explain the concept in plain terms, then map it to source names.

## Review Checklist

Before finishing a chapter, verify:

- The opening reads like a book, not a work log.
- Every concept appears after its prerequisites.
- Every symbol is defined before use.
- Formula signs are traced to explicit causes.
- Theory notation and source-code variables are separated.
- Source-code evidence appears after the reader can understand the theory.
- Project-specific concepts are introduced before their formulas depend on them.
- Tables and summaries reinforce the narrative rather than replacing derivation.
- The chapter can be read linearly without jumping forward for definitions.
- Related sections, adjacent chapters, appendices, symbol tables, and source bridges were checked after edits so the book remains connected rather than a set of isolated answers.
